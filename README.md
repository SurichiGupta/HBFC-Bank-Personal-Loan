# HBFC-Bank-Personal-Loan
“Finding out potential target customers for personal loans”
In this case study, the goal of HBFC bank is to sell more personal loans to their savings account 
holders. The bank wants to start a campaign to sell the personal loans, but before that they 
want to analyze last marketing campaign data to understand the profile of potential loan 
customers. This will help them in doing a targeted approach to the prospective customers in 
future. The bank has approached you, to help them with the analysis of the previous campaign 
data. The bank basically has two customers,
• Liability customers – They deposit the money in the bank and pays interest against 
the deposited money.
• Asset customers - They borrow money (take different types of loan) from the bank 
and the bank charges interest against the borrowed money.
At present the bank has small number of asset/loan customers. The bank wants to increase 
their income by increasing the customer base of “asset customers”. Last year the bank ran a 
campaign where they successfully converted 9% of the existing “liability customers” to “asset 
customers”. This has encouraged the bank to have a better targeted marketing campaign to 
increase the success ratio with minimum budget.
